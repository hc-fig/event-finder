# NodeJS example
This is an example server written in [NodeJS](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_intro.asp) using [express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)
to handle requests. 

## Prerequisites
You'll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (I recommend the latest version) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), a javascript package manager
that will install express for you. If you're using a mac, the easiest way to install these is to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
Once you have homebrew, you should be able to `brew install npm` and `brew install node`. If you're on ubuntu, use `apt install npm node`.
If you're on windows, just use the downloadable installers from the websites.

## Usage
You can run the server with `node index.js`. Then navigate to http://localhost:8000.
