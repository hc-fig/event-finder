# Flask
Here's the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) intro.

## Prerequisites
Python, flask. Flask can be installed with `pip install flask`.

## Usage
`./run.sh` should start the flask server. You might need to set it as executable first with `chmod +x run.sh`.

You should then be able to get to the server at http://localhost:5000.
